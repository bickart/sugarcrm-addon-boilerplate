# SugarCRM Add-on Boilerplate

A starting point for creating a SugarCRM add-on. Grab it and use it for your own add-ons. This is a Sugar 7 first implementation that also works with Sugar 6.

# Current Features & Examples

* Install Wizard
* [License Key Protection](https://www.sugaroutfitters.com/selling/license)
* Scheduler Job Installation
* Default Configurations
* Admin Menu
* License Placeholder

There are more commented out capabilities to help jump start your implementation in both manifest.php and /scripts/post_install.php. Examples include conditional install based on environment version, adding fields to the UI in both Sugar 6 and 7, creating default reports, and creating non-standard (non-bean). tables. You can also do [user-based licensing](https://www.sugaroutfitters.com/selling/license) to allow for only certain users to use your add-on.
